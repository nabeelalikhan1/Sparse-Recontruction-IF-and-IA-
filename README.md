Run MSE_GAPS_SNR to obtain error curves for SNR ratios 0dB ,10 dB, 20 dB and 30 dB. Note that here we consider a 2 component fixed amplitude signal
from which samples are removed in gaps
Run MSE_GAPS_SNR to obtain error curves for SNR ratios 0dB ,10 dB, 20 dB and 30 dB. Note that here we consider a 2 component time-varying amplitude signal
from which samples are removed in gaps
Run Illustration_GAPS_new to visualize the reconstruction performance of the proposed method.
Run MSE_fixed_amp_GAPS to  obtain error curves for sparsely sampled fixed amplitude signal where samples have been removed in gaps. 
Run MSE_TV_GAPS to  obtain error curves for sparsely sampled time varying amplitude signal where samples have been removed in gaps. 
MSE_TV_GAPS_BAT to obtain error curves for sparsely sampled bat signal.
